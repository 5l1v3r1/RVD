        An issue surfaced when building the Docker image, as it could
        not find tf2 packages. This was due to the repository being named
        `geometry_experimental` at the time this issue was reported, and
        having been renamed to `geometry2` later on. To fix this, the
        rosinstall file had to be patched manually. Cf. issue
        https://github.com/robust-rosin/robust/issues/63.

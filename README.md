# RVDP
Robot Vulnerability Disclosure Program

## Instructions
In order to add a vulnerability to the RVDP repository, we provide a public web formulary at https://www.aliasrobotics.com/bounties.htm or use GitHub issue [template](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVDP/issues/new/choose).

Please, fill out the form with as much information as possible, this will allow the vendor to validate the issue in less time.

You'll get public acknowledgement by reporting Robot Vulnerabilities.

In case the vulnerability reporting form is sent on behalf of a researcher or Research Group, we encourage citing original reporters in the description.
